###### Project Requirement

To achieve the innovative functionality of WarmSole, we leverage a robust technology stack centered around the ESP-IDF framework, optimized for the ESP32-C3 microcontroller. This framework provides the foundation for seamless communication between the microcontroller, smartphone app, and peripheral devices. The integration of an NTC temperature sensor enables precise monitoring of foot temperature, ensuring optimal comfort levels. Paired with a Li-ion battery for portable power, our system efficiently manages energy consumption to extend usage time. The heart of WarmSole lies in its heating element, strategically positioned within the shoe to evenly distribute warmth. Implementation requires expertise in embedded systems development, proficiency with the ESP-IDF framework, and a thorough understanding of sensor integration and power management techniques. By harnessing these technologies, we deliver a sophisticated solution that redefines winter footwear comfort.
