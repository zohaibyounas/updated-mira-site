### Description

The Laser Pointing and Object Detection System integrates laser positioning, object detection, and remote control via the Blynk Cloud platform. Using an ESP32 microcontroller, two servo motors, a laser module, and a PIR sensor, it offers precise laser direction and real-time object detection. The ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi and the Blynk app, allowing users to remotely control the system, set parameters, and receive feedback on angles and detection status. The system calculates angles and adjusts servos based on received distance values, while the PIR sensor detects motion to trigger actions. The Blynk app adds versatility with features like game modes, automated drills, and custom configurations, suitable for educational, interactive, and automated applications.
