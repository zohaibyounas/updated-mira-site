### Description

Our innovative Battery Management System (BMS) project employs advanced techniques to ensure optimal cell voltage balance, significantly enhancing battery lifespan. Utilizing a hybrid model combining Kalman filter and Coulomb counting methods, we achieved remarkable results. This project was developed for use in automotive battery systems, demonstrating our commitment to delivering high-quality, reliable solutions for our clients.

###### Project Requirement

- Development of the layout for the battery management system
- Selection and definition of components and sensors
- Creation of specifications related to the BMS
- Implementation of functional safety hardware and software based on EN 61508
- Integration of existing software tools
- Integration of sensors and actuators
- Fault simulations
- Development of software diagnostic tools
- Conducting hardware-in-the-loop tests
- Programming and implementation of a cell balancing algorithm
- Programming and implementation of cell-dependent SOC (State of Charge)
- Programming and implementation of cell-dependent SOH (State of Health)
- Negotiations with suppliers

###### Future Plans

We are committed to continuously improving our BMS tool by enhancing its functionality and expanding its capabilities. Future updates may include support for additional microcontroller families, integration with popular IDEs, and further customization options based on user feedback.
