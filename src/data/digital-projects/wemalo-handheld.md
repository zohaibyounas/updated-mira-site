### Description

Handheld by Wemalo represents a successfully completed project that offer a comprehensive design to optimize daily tasks, from receiving goods to relocating products in the warehouse. The application efficiently and effectively addresses key warehouse operations, including goods receiving, returns, picking, packing and relocation.

###### Project Requirement

In the interviews with warehouse workers we identified the main tasks in the warehouse, such as receiving goods, picking, packing and repositioning of products within the warehouse, these tasks were performed with a laptop computer which gave less capacity for movement, they also had to do steps that could be dispensed with.

**1. Adaptation to Specific Tasks**

- Wemalo gave a solution but Laptops are generalist devices and may not be optimized for specific warehouse tasks, such as fast barcode scanning or real-time inventory tracking.

**2. No Task-Specific Adaptability**

- although WEMALO is a solution it does not offer specialized functions and features, improving efficiency in tasks such as picking, packing and relocation.

**3. Non-Touch or Slower Interaction**

- Tasks with slow interaction can result in processes that are more time consuming and not as agile, especially in situations where quick response or decision making is needed, this creates an impact on productivity.
