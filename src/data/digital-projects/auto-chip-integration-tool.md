### Description

Introducing our advanced desktop application, specifically designed for developers working with STM32 series microcontrollers. Our C# software simplifies the process of extracting variables from debug files created by Keil uVision projects. Instead of manually sifting through data, our tool automates this task, efficiently gathering crucial information like variable names, addresses, sizes, module names, and data types. With a user-friendly interface, anyone can easily navigate and utilize our software to gain valuable insights into their projects. Using the latest technology, we ensure accuracy and reliability in every extraction. Plus, we've made it easy to organize and access this data by converting it into XML format. This makes storing, retrieving, and analyzing the information a breeze. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, our software is here to streamline your workflow and boost productivity. Try it out and see the difference it can make in your STM32 projects!

###### Project Overview

Embedded systems development often entails navigating intricate debug files to extract essential variables' information, including addresses, sizes, module names, and data types. Our tool simplifies this process by automating the extraction and organizing the data into a structured XML format.

###### Future Plans

As we continue to iterate on our tool, we're committed to enhancing its functionality and expanding its capabilities. Future updates may include support for additional microcontroller families, integration with popular IDEs, and further customization options based on user feedback.
