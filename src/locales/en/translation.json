  "<p>In this FPGA based project PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique used to control power delivery to electrical devices by varying the width of pulses in  signal. It is achieves this by comparing a controller output signal with a reference triangular signal, generating a series of pulses that adjust the switching state of the device. This precise control allows for efficient regulation of motor speeds, LED brightness, and power supplies.</p>": "<p>In this FPGA based project PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique used to control power delivery to electrical devices by varying the width of pulses in  signal.
